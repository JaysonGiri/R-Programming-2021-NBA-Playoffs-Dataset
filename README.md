# NBA Shot Outcome Prediction

This project analyzes NBA player shooting data and builds machine learning models to predict whether a shot is made or missed based on various player, defender, and range attributes. The analysis explores data understanding, feature encoding, model training, and performance comparison across multiple algorithms.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Understand patterns and trends in NBA playersâ€™ shooting performance

- Build predictive models to classify shot outcomes

- Evaluate model accuracy and identify the most influential factors

## Key Steps

1. Data Understanding and Exploration

    - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using dplyr, ggplot2, and skimr

    - Summarized key statistics and visualized distributions and relationships

2. Data Preparation

    - Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values

    - Applied one-hot encoding using fastDummies for categorical features (Shooter, Defender, Range)

3. Model Development

    - Trained multiple models using the caret package:

        - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

        - Random Forest (RF)

        - Neural Network (NN)

    - Used 10-fold cross-validation for model evaluation

4. Performance Evaluation

    - Assessed models using confusion matrices and accuracy scores

    - Compared model performance and feature importance

## Tech Stack

Language: R

Libraries: caret, dplyr, ggplot2, fastDummies, skimr

RStudio
